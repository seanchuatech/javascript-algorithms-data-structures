Tree
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges
A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
In linear data structures, the time required to search is a proportional to the size of the data set
Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data
A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

Tree Usage
File systems for directory structure
A family tree
An organisation tree
