/* 
Map
A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data type
To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key
Maps are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop

Object vs Map 
Objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered
Keys in objects can only be string or symbol type whereas in maps, they can be of any type
An object has a prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own keys if you're not careful. A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default
Objects are not iterables where as maps are iterables
The bumber of items in an object must be determined manually where as it is readily available with the size property in a map
Apart from storing data, you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps are restricted to just storing data
