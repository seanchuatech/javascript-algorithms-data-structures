Big-O Guide
Calculation not dependent on input size- O(1)
1 loop - O(n)
2 nested loops - O(n^2)
Input size reduced by half - O(logn)

Algorithm Design Techniques

Brute Force - Simple and exhausive technique that evaluates every posible outcome to find the best solution. Ex.: Linear search 

Greedy - Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future. Ex.: Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm

Divide and Conquer - Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-probblem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution. Ex.: Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Tower of Hanoi

Backtracking - Generate all possible solutions. Check if the solution satisfies all the given constrains and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions. If the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution. Ex: N-Queens problem
